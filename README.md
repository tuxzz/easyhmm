# easyhmm
An easy-to-use Hidden Markov Model Interface written in Python

## TODO
* [ ] HMM Viterbi
* [ ] Learning for Initial Probablity and Transition Probablity
* [ ] HMM Forward-Backward
* [ ] HSMM Viterbi
* [ ] HSMM Forward-Backward

## Note
We have better choice instead of Forward-Backward or GMM.  
So, will not implement.
